# Dungeons, Dragons, and Distribution 

I noticed that my Dungeons and Dragons-related projects were sort of morphing into their own thing, so I decided to create a separate repository for them. 
Much of these projects are, or are going to be, R practice, as Dungeons and Dragons is a game full of probability. 

I've actually only been learning both R and DnD for the past couple of months as of October 2024, so there is likely going to be some mistakes in some descriptions. Additionally, some of the code might not follow best practices. 
Still, what matters is that I'm having fun and learning, I guess.
